                        Various  sparse-representation-based  methods  have
been   proposed   to   solve   tracking   problems,   and   most   of
them  employ  least  squares  (LSs)  criteria  to  learn  the  sparse
representation. In many tracking scenarios, traditional LS-based
methods  may  not  perform  well  owing  to  the  presence  of  heavy-
tailed noise. In this paper, we present a tracking approach using
an  approximate  least  absolute  deviation  (LAD)-based  multitask
multiview  sparse  learning  method  to  enjoy  robustness  of  LAD
and take  advantage  of  multiple types  of  visual  features,  such as
intensity, color,  and  texture.  The  proposed  method  is  integrated
in  a  particle  filter framework,  where  learning  the sparse  repre-
sentation  for  each  view  of  the  single  particle  is  regarded  as  an
individual task. The underlying relationship between tasks across
different  views  and  different  particles  is  jointly  exploited  in  a
unified robust multitask formulation based on LAD. In addition,
to  capture the  frequently emerging  outlier tasks,  we  decompose
the  representation  matrix  to  two  collaborative  components  that
enable  a  more  robust  and  accurate  approximation.  We  show
that  the  proposed  formulation  can  be  effectively  approximated
by Nesterovâ€™s smoothing method and efficiently solved using the
accelerated  proximal  gradient  method.  The  presented  tracker
is  implemented  using  four  types  of  features  and  is  tested  on
numerous  synthetic  sequences  and  real-world  video  sequences,
including  the  CVPR2013  tracking  benchmark  and  ALOV
++
data set. Both the qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
the  superior  performance  of  the  proposed  approach  compared
with several  state-of-the-art  trackers.
